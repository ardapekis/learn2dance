*insert how to use code here*

For the future: 

The most obvious task would be to get a higher accuracy with the results, and collecting and training on more data would definitely help with that. In addition, it may be a good idea to focus on one specific type of dance or song category, and attempt to collect data that specifically relates to that one type of dance, such as hip-hop, and get good results on that before including other categories. We may have been a bit ambitious with this project and better results may be obtained by training the model category-wise. 

But above all - have fun with this! We enjoyed working on this project and it was a lot of fun, regardless of the results. We all learned a lot and who knows? Maybe you'll even learn2dance a little :D
